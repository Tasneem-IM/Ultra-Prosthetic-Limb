      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The loss of limbs due to wars, disasters, accidents, or illness leaves many individuals facing significant challenges in their daily lives. Current prosthetic devices often fail to meet their needs in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of Responsiveness</li>
        <li>Inability to Predict Movement</li>
        <li>Generic Designs</li>
        <li>Limited Adaptability</li>
        <li>Weak Data Security</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="objective">
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>Develop a smart system integrating quantum computing, AI, and sensors to enhance prosthetic functionality and overcome current limitations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="innovations">
      <h2>Innovations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Instant Response: Quantum computing enables real-time analysis of bio-signals.</li>
